# stylerequest

The company that never was. Lived 2019-2021. StyleRequest was a stylist/spa booking platform that's presented like Instagram. The app had two services: Stylist and Spa. 

The Stylist tab had an 'explore' page that shows trending hairstyles. On tapping a hairstyle, you could book with the author of the style. 
The app also shows you stylists around you where you could tap and book appointment.

There's a Spa tab that works exactly the same. 

Though we built the product, the idea eventually got shelved in 2021.

Thank you to everyone who provided feedback, encouragement, criticism. They've made me a better thinker and doer.

Bye for now.
